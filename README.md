To setup a deployment-ready instance of the project, you will need to use Docker.
After installing it, simply navigate to the project root and run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

After containers start up, the website will be available on http://localhost/ over port 80 by default. The API can be accessed under http://localhost/api/.
